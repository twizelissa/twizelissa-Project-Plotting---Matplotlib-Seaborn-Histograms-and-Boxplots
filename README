# Fuel Efficiency Analysis with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook is a visualization-based analysis of a fuel economy dataset, focused on exploring relationships between different vehicle attributes like engine size, fuel type, and emissions. The aim is to prepare the data for future AI applications by extracting meaningful visual insights.

The project is part of the **ASC23 assignment on Transport Systems**, specifically analyzing vehicles and fuel efficiency.

## 📊 Diagram Interpretations

### 🔹 Histogram: Fuel Efficiency (mpg)
Shows the distribution of miles per gallon. Most vehicles cluster around average efficiency. Few vehicles are extremely fuel-efficient or inefficient.

### 🔹 Heatmap: Correlation Matrix
Highlights relationships between numeric features. Strong correlations help identify redundant or unimportant columns, e.g.:
- `UCity` and `city` are highly correlated.
- If a column has a correlation ~1 or ~0 with others, it might be a candidate for removal.
